                                    Alex has specialised in cyber security, software engineering and data analytics over the last 8 years. He has a master's in mechanical engineering where he designed simulations of heat engines to improve the cost of manufacture and research.
                                    He has a background as a penetration tester and has provided cyber security consultancy to the government. When he is not giving talks about AI, Alex runs a blockchain and data analytics consultancy in London.
                                    Alex is passionate about demystifying technology for senior leaders, but also challenging them on the impact on their organisations and how they can reshape these companies to better their use of data and better the world they affect.

                                    Robin is a designer, developer and creative technologist. Learning to code was a fundamental step in facilitating a move from traditional graphic design into digital design early on in his career.
                                    Fascinated by how each and every one of us interacts with technology differently, Robin started delivering workshops on all aspects of the digital spectrum 6 years ago. Current areas of interest include internet of things, blockchain, security and future technologies.
                                    Robin has been running his own digital consultancy Designingreen Ltd for over 9 years and is about to embark on a new venture in the world of connected devices, robingreen.house.
